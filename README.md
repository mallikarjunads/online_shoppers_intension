The Customer Buying Behavior dataset contains information about customer characteristics, purchase history, and product features to predict whether a customer will buy a product or not.
Variables may include:

- Demographic data (age, gender, income)
- Purchase history (previous purchases, frequency, amount)
- Product features (price, category, brand)
- Customer behavior (browsing history, search queries)

This dataset can be used to train machine learning models to predict customer buying behavior, helping businesses personalize marketing, improve customer experience, and increase sales.
